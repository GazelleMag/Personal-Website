    <h2 class="mb-4">A bit about myself</h2>
    <p>I'm a 25 years old web and game developer located in Portugal.</p>
    <p>I've always been in contact with computers from a very young age, and loving it.
      It was only natural for me to get into code, pursue a degree in computer science and making
      a career out of it.
    </p>
    <p>I love to solve problems, simple and complex ones. It's also a blessing to be able to
      learn from them everyday.<br>
      More than anything, my passion is and always will be bringing amazing and creative ideas to life.
    </p>
    <p>Let me also say that I'm very into sports, being with friends and playing video games. Above everything,
      I am human!
